This site contains lesson modules written by NYPL Digital Preservation to explore and improve development skills with Python.

An ideal of Python is that, "There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it."
The reality is that there are many ways to do anything.
That can make it very hard to learn how to do anything.

Each lesson presents a way to use Python.
The way presented is not the only way and may not be the best way.
It is only a way.
Hopefully, it's a pretty good way.

There is a rough sequence to these modules:

1. Creating an Environment - everything about writing Python that doesn't involve Python (shells, git, code editors, etc) (complete draft)
2. Surveying files - the building blocks of any Python script (variables, for-loops, functions, etc) (not started)
3. Rewriting ft.sh - turning a script into a dependable tool (unit testing, command line interfaces, importing modules, etc) (in progress)
4. Writing a package - using tools to write code that feels more professional (packaging, version testing, linting, formatting, etc) (in development)
5. Pulling data - interacting with APIs to get data and write data (not started)
