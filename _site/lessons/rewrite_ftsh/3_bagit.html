<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Creating file fixtures to test file manipulations</li>
  <li>Using bagit-python within a python script</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bagging-requirements">Bagging Requirements</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-python</code> is most commonly used as a command-line tool, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit.py --validate path/to/bag</code>.
However, that shell tool is itself a Python script, with classes and functions you can import into other Python scripts.</p>

<p>This was the same case as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-java</code> which was used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ft.sh</code>.
Part of the reason for rewriting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ft.sh</code> was that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-java</code> removed its command-line interface.
That meant that we would either have to maintain an out-of-date version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-java</code>, rewrite <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ft.sh</code> as a Java applet, or switch to another <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit</code> tool.
As long as we were switching to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-python</code> we might as improve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ft.sh</code> as well.</p>

<p>Our goal in using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bagit-python</code> is to have a structure that holds fixity information that we can reuse when we return to a project, weeks or months later.
We’d like for the fixity information to be generated from the original file from the media.
And we’d like to know if anything went wrong during the transfer.</p>

<p>So for bagging, we have a few requirements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>transfer the files from the carrier to the destination</li>
  <li>package files into a bag</li>
  <li>report if there were any files left behind</li>
  <li>report the number and total size of the files</li>
</ol>
