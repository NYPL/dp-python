You have probably customized your computer.
A custom foldering schema to manage your files.
A different browser to access the Internet the way you want.
An ad blocker or three to protect your data.
Adapting the computer to your needs transforms it from a useful tool to your effective tool.

We can and should take similar steps when preparing a computer to become a tool for Python tool creation and usage.
This guide focuses on four key areas.

* Shell and Terminal
  * Understanding the terminal
  * Creating a profile
  * Customizing a prompt
* Virtual Environments
  * Managing Python versions
  * Managing Python modules
* Code Editing
  * Launching Visual Studio Code from the terminal
  * Linting Python in VS Code
  * Extending VS Code functions
* Version Control
  * Setting up git
  * Configuring git with Github

This particular approach was developed with a few philosophies.

### Keyboard First

The keyboard is the most common, and sometimes only, computer interface.
In order to work in environments ranging from your personal computer to a VM in a data center, being familiar with keyboard navigation is key.

### Containment

Any changes to the computer should be easily reversible.

### Mac/Linux First
