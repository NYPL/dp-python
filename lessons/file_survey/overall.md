This initial module runs through core Python  concepts through the concept of a file survey script.
The script will address a common use case, surveying a set of folders, retrieving a list of files, and then performing an operation on them.
That operation could be gathering data, renaming the files, another task, or a combination of tasks.

In doing so, the focus will be more on the meta-aspects of creating a script than on the mechanics of data types, for-loops, and other concepts.
The resulting Python script will probably look different than what you might typically write, but not quite what you might be see a professional developer write.

A core part of this module is in planning the approach to the problem as a series of smaller steps.
Then, each step can be addressed individually.
And the parts of Python you need to address it should be much smaller and more self-evident.

Everyone has their own approach to this process.
My preferred method is either making a numbered list or a flow diagram with annotations for what information is generated at each step.
Yours may look very different, but I heavily suggest using something that you feel comfortable editing heavily, whether through scribbling, overdrawing, copy-pasting, or however you prefer.

1. Flow drafting and procedural approaches
2. Script boilerplate and naming things
3. Creating functions and type hinting
4. Running shell programs and parsing results
